# SoC Research Platform
To build a System-on-Chip (SoC) research platform for teaching and research, you can follow these steps and leverage various resources and methodologies provided by community
 
### 1. Define the SoC Design Specification
  * Operation Modes: Determine the operation modes of the system and the performance requirements.
  * Hardware and Software Requirements: Identify the necessary hardware IPs and software modules, w 

### 2. Leverage Arm Corstone Compute Subsystem
  * Reference Designs: Utilize pre-verified hardware and software reference designs from Arm Corstone to accelerate the development process and ensure compatibility and performance .
    
### 3. Prototyping on FPGA
  * FPGA Implementation: Implement a hardware prototype of the system on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. This stage can be divided into three phases:
    * Functional Design Phase: Create a behavioral model of the hardware and a working prototype of the software 1 .
    * Circuit Design Phase: Transfer the behavioral descriptions of the functional blocks into circuits. This process is automated for digital blocks and manual for analog blocks.
    * Physical Design Phase: Perform tasks such as floorplanning, pad ring design, placement, clock tree design, power and IR drop analysis, routing, and design rule checks.

### 4. Integrate Hardware and Software
  * Hardware Integration: Integrate the sourced hardware IPs to form the SoC.
  * Software Integration: Combine the necessary drivers and software modules 1 .
  * Functional Simulation: Perform functional simulation to verify that the IPs and their integration produce the expected outcomes 1 .
    
### 5. HW/SW Co-Verification
  * Co-Simulation: Run co-simulation of hardware and software to refine the components. This iterative process may require additional software development and hardware optimizations.

### 6. Application Development and Testing
  * Application Development: Develop and test applications on the SoC platform to ensure it meets the desired performance and functionality.
  * Volume Manufacture and Ship: After successful testing, proceed with volume manufacturing and shipping of the final product.

### 7. Physical Optimization and Fabrication
  * Physical Design: Optimize the physical design for timing and power analysis. Perform detailed functional simulation and software verification after each step.
  * Fabrication: Once all aspects of the systemâ€™s specifications have been verified, send the prototype to the chip fabrication foundry for mass production.
    
By following these steps and leveraging the resources and methodologies provided by Arm Education, you can effectively build and verify a custom SoC for teaching and research purposes.
