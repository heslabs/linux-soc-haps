## Arm Corstone Subsystem
The Arm Corstone family is designed to help reduce design complexity and speed time –to market. Corstone balances trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency by providing a large amount of software, IP blocks, and a configurable, modifiable, heterogeneous subsystem.

* SoC designers use Arm Corstone as a framework to build an SoC using the modifiable, configurable, heterogenous subsystem.
* Software developers use Corstone software components and tools to get started with the software development before the hardware is ready.
