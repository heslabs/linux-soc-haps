# FPGA Development Workflow
To develop an FPGA-based System-on-Chip (SoC) with remote access, custom IP, and a compute subsystem, follow these steps:

## 1. Setup FPGA Cloud for Remote Access

* Cloud Infrastructure: Set up a cloud environment that supports FPGA development. This can be done using cloud services that offer FPGA instances, such as AWS F1 instances or Azure N-series VMs.
* Remote Access Tools: Use remote access tools like SSH, VPN, or cloud-specific remote desktop solutions to access the FPGA development environment.

## 2. Develop Your Custom IP

  * Design Specification: Define the functionality and performance requirements of your custom IP.
  * HDL Coding: Write the hardware description in Verilog or VHDL. Use FPGA vendor tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus) for coding and simulation.
  * Simulation and Verification: Simulate the custom IP to verify its functionality using tools like ModelSim or Vivado Simulator.
  * Synthesis: Synthesize the IP to ensure it meets the timing and area constraints.

## 3. Develop Compute Subsystem (Arm Corstone or Simplified Version)
    * Arm Corstone: Utilize Arm Corstone IP for a pre-verified compute subsystem. Corstone IP includes subsystems based on Arm Cortex processors, bus infrastructure components, and baseline peripherals 1 .
    * Simplified Version: If using a simplified version, design a basic compute subsystem with essential components like CPU, memory, and communication interfaces.

## 4. Integrate Custom IP with Pre-built Compute Subsystem
    * System Integration: Integrate your custom IP with the compute subsystem. Ensure compatibility with the system bus (e.g., AMBA AXI) and other interfaces.
    * FPGA Fabric: Map the integrated design onto the FPGA fabric. This involves placing and routing the design using FPGA vendor tools.
Verification: Perform system-level verification to ensure the integrated design functions correctly.

## 5. Running Linux and AI/ML Software
    * Bootloader and Kernel: Develop or configure a bootloader (e.g., U-Boot) and Linux kernel for your SoC. Ensure the kernel supports the hardware components in your design.
    * Root Filesystem: Create a root filesystem with necessary libraries and tools for AI/ML development.
    * Deployment: Deploy the Linux image onto the FPGA. This can be done via JTAG, SD card, or network boot.
    * AI/ML Frameworks: Install AI/ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX Runtime on the Linux system. Ensure the frameworks are optimized for the hardware.
